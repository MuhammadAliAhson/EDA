## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key features (expand based on your data):
- **Feature 1**: Description (e.g., Age of the individual)
- **Feature 2**: Description (e.g., Dietary preferences)
- **Feature 3**: Description (e.g., Frequency of fast-food consumption)
- *(Add more features as needed.)*

## Analysis Overview
The notebook performs the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing or null values.
   - Correcting inconsistencies in categorical data.
   - Feature engineering, if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Examining individual features (e.g., histograms, pie charts).
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Exploring relationships between two variables (e.g., scatter plots, correlation heatmaps).
   - **Multivariate Analysis**: Analyzing patterns across multiple variables.

3. **Insights and Observations**
   - Key findings about dietary preferences, health trends, and demographics.
